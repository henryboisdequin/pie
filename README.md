# pie

Pie is an algebra calculator. It takes an input (linear equation or combining like terms) and
turns it into a stream of tokens to an ast to eventually the final answer. The way I am doing this (with an ast)
allows for my calculator to give a reason why the algorithm came up with that solution. It will be
able to give in-depth steps on how it has done it which is something very few calculators do today.
This project can be expanded to work with more algebraic problems, word problems, geometry problems,
or statistical problems and graphing.
